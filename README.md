Project Description
This project is a submission for DCIT 318 â€“ Programming II Assignment 2. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# using three separate console applications:

1.  Inheritance and Method Overriding (InheritanceDemo)
    This project defines a base class Animal with a virtual method MakeSound(). Two subclasses, Dog and Cat, override this method to produce their own specific sounds ("Bark" and "Meow"). It showcases how method overriding works in inheritance hierarchies.

2.  Abstract Classes and Methods (AbstractDemo)
    This project introduces an abstract class Shape with an abstract method GetArea(). Two concrete subclasses, Circle and Rectangle, implement the GetArea() method to return their respective areas. It demonstrates the use of abstraction and polymorphism.

3.  Interfaces (InterfaceDemo)
    This project defines an interface IMovable with a method Move(). Two classes, Car and Bicycle, implement this interface and provide their own version of the Move() method. This demonstrates how interfaces define contracts that classes must fulfill.

Each application was written and tested independently using the .NET CLI and Visual Studio Code. The repository contains a README.md, and each folder contains a Program.cs file and its corresponding .csproj file
